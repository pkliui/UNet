# UNet
This is an ongoing pytorch-implementation of the UNet architecture for image segmentation.

The code structure is based on the PyTorch project [template] (https://github.com/melanibe/PyTorch-Project-Template). 

The template defines classes for creation of datasets, data loaders (incl. training/validation split), model, training procedure definition.

Once completed, the code can be used for segmentation of images. The next step is to use it as a basis for image enhancement (see [my concept of image enhancement by neural networks](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/image-enhancement/image-enhancement.pdf)).
